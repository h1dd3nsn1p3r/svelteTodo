# Todo App Using Svelte

This is my first attempt at using Svelte. I have used Svelte to create a simple todo app. I have used json-server to create a fake REST API to store the todo items. 

## Setup

Clone this repo & run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. Once you are done installing the dependencies, its time to install the json-server globally. Run `npm install -g json-server` to install the json-server globally.Once dependencies has been installed, running the app is pretty simple. Just run `npm run dev` to start the app & run `npm run db` to start the json-server.
