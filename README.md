# Todo App Using Svelte

This is my first attempt at using Svelte. I have used Svelte to create a simple todo app. I have used json-server to create a fake REST API to store the todo items. 

## Installation

- Clone this repo.
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

Once you are done installing the dependencies, its time to install the json-server globally. 

- Run `npm install -g json-server` to install the json-server globally.

## Running the app

- Run `npm run dev` to start the app.
- Run `npm run db` to start the json-server.
